## Key Components

### Editor Layout
The main editor interface consists of multiple panels:
- **Left Sidebar**: Node library, route manager, and project navigation
- **Canvas**: Main workspace for building workflows
- **Right Dock**: Variable inspector and execution output
- **Bottom Panel**: Logs, chat, and execution monitoring

### Node System
Nodes are the building blocks of workflows:
- Each node has inputs, outputs, and configurable properties
- Nodes communicate through typed connections
- Variables flow through the graph automatically
- Execution happens in topological order

### State Management
The application uses multiple Zustand stores:
- `editorStore`: Canvas state, selection, and UI modes
- `nodesStore`: Node data, connections, and variables
- `executionStore`: Workflow execution and monitoring
- `chatStore`: AI chat integration and history

## Execution Modes

### Development Mode
- Full UI interaction enabled
- Real-time variable inspection
- Interactive debugging capabilities
- Manual execution control

### Execution Mode
- Streamlined interface during workflow runs
- Disabled node selection and editing
- Automatic output panel activation
- Live log streaming

## Integration

This project is designed as a submodule of the [PolySynergy Orchestrator](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-orchestrator), which handles:
- Environment setup and configuration
- Backend service orchestration
- Authentication and user management
- Deployment and scaling

## Technology Highlights

### Canvas Rendering
- Hardware-accelerated graphics via Konva.js
- Smooth zoom and pan interactions
- Layer-based rendering for optimal performance
- Custom node shapes and connection styles

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket-based live updates
- Collaborative cursor tracking
- Instant variable propagation
- Live execution monitoring
