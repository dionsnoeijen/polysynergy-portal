# Welcome Splash Screen Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a beautiful welcome splash screen with 3D brain animation that shows on first login.

## What Was Done

### 1. Copied Components from Website
- ✅ Copied `Brain3D.tsx` from polysynergy-website-v2 to `src/components/welcome/Brain3D.tsx`
- ✅ Copied `Scene.ts` from polysynergy-website-v2 to `src/components/welcome/Scene.ts`
- ✅ Copied `logo-with-text.svg` to `public/logo-with-text.svg`

### 2. Added Dependencies to package.json
- ✅ Added `three: ^0.170.0`
- ✅ Added `postprocessing: ^6.36.2`
- ✅ Added `@types/three: ^0.170.0`

### 3. Created WelcomeSplashScreen Component
Location: `src/components/welcome/WelcomeSplashScreen.tsx`

Features:
- 3D brain animation background
- PolySynergy logo
- Welcome message
- Alpha release notice
- Contact information:
  - Email: dion@polysynergy.com
  - Discord: https://discord.gg/g3atXten
  - GitHub Issues: https://github.com/polysynergy/polysynergy/issues
- Beautiful gradient overlay
- Smooth fade-in/out animations
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)

### 4. Integrated First-Login Tracking
Modified: `src/components/auth/auth-wrapper.tsx`

Implementation:
- Uses localStorage with key `hasSeenWelcome_{cognito_id}` to track per-user
- Shows splash screen only on first login after account activation
- Dynamically loaded component (SSR disabled for Three.js compatibility)
- Dismisses on "Get Started" button click

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

### Install Dependencies
The dependencies are in package.json but need to be installed:

```bash
# Inside Docker container
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### Test the Implementation
1. Clear localStorage to simulate first login:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see the welcome splash screen with the animated brain

### Optional Customizations
You may want to adjust:
- GitHub issues link (currently: https://github.com/polysynergy/polysynergy/issues)
- Color scheme (currently: purple/pink gradient)
- Animation timing
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy links (footer)

```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **three**: Core 3D library for WebGL rendering
- **postprocessing**: Post-processing effects (FXAA anti-aliasing)
- **@types/three**: TypeScript definitions for Three.js

### First-Login Detection
- Storage: `localStorage`
- Key format: `hasSeenWelcome_{cognito_id}`
- Checked in: AuthWrapper after successful account fetch
- Cleared when: User clicks "Get Started"

### Performance
- Dynamic import prevents SSR issues with Three.js
- Loading fallback displays while component loads
- Brain animation runs on requestAnimationFrame
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Notes
- The splash screen only appears for authenticated, active accounts
- Multiple users on same browser each see the splash once (per cognito ID)
- The 3D brain is wireframe with animated rainbow/purple shader
- Mobile-responsive design with adjusted camera position for small screens
