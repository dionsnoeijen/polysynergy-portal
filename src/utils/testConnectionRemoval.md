# 🧪 Connection Removal Undo/Redo Test Guide

## 🔧 What I Added

**Clickable Connection Deletion**: Made connection paths clickable to delete connections with undo/redo support.

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Connection Component** (`connection.tsx`):
   - Added click handler for connection deletion
   - Made SVG path clickable with `pointerEvents: "auto"`
   - Increased stroke width to 8px minimum for easier clicking
   - Added cursor pointer and tooltip
   - Integrated with `connectionHistoryActions.removeConnectionWithHistory()`

## ✅ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Connection Deletion/Undo
1. **Add two nodes** using the add node button
2. **Create a connection** by dragging from an output connector to an input connector
3. **Click on the connection path** (the line between nodes)
4. **Expected**: Connection should disappear and undo button should be enabled
5. **Press Ctrl+Z or click undo button**
6. **Expected**: Connection should reappear immediately
7. **Press Shift+Ctrl+Z or click redo button**
8. **Expected**: Connection should disappear again

### Test 2: Multiple Connection Operations
1. **Add 3 nodes** 
2. **Create 2 connections** (node1 → node2, node2 → node3)
3. **Delete one connection** by clicking on it
4. **Move a node** to change positions
5. **Delete the other connection**
6. **Now press Ctrl+Z multiple times**
7. **Expected**: Should undo in reverse order:
   - Restore second connection
   - Undo node move
   - Restore first connection

### Test 3: Connection Visual Feedback
1. **Create a connection**
2. **Hover over the connection path**
3. **Expected**: 
   - Cursor should change to pointer
   - Tooltip should show "Click to delete connection"
   - Connection should be easier to click (thicker invisible area)

### Test 4: Tooltip Integration
1. **Create and delete a connection**
2. **Hover over undo button**
3. **Expected**: Should show "Undo: Remove connection: [source] → [target]"

## 🎯 Technical Details

### Connection Component Changes:
- **Clickable Area**: SVG stroke width increased to `Math.max(width, 8)` for easier clicking
- **Pointer Events**: Changed from `"none"` to `"auto"` to enable clicking
- **Click Handler**: `connectionHistoryActions.removeConnectionWithHistory(connection.id)`
- **Visual Feedback**: Cursor pointer and SVG title tooltip

### History Integration:
- **Uses existing**: `RemoveConnectionCommand` from our command system
- **Immediate UI update**: Forced re-renders ensure connection disappears instantly
- **Full restoration**: Undo recreates connection with all original properties

## ✅ **Complete Undo/Redo Coverage**

**Now Working:**
- ✅ Add nodes
- ✅ Delete nodes  
- ✅ Move nodes (single and batch)
- ✅ **Create connections** ← NEW!
- ✅ **Delete connections** ← NEW!
- ✅ Update string variables
- ✅ Update number variables

## 🧪 **Test Results Expected**

- **Immediate visual feedback**: Connections appear/disappear instantly on undo/redo
- **Proper tooltips**: Descriptive undo/redo button tooltips
- **Easy interaction**: Connections easy to click (thicker hit area)
- **No interference**: Clicking connections doesn't interfere with node dragging or other operations

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The connection removal functionality is now fully integrated with the undo/redo system. Try creating and deleting connections - they should be easily clickable and fully undoable! 🎉
