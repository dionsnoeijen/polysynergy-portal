# 🧪 Connection & Variable Undo/Redo Test Guide

## 🔧 What I Added

1. **Connection Creation**: Integrated `useOutConnectorHandler.ts` with history system
2. **Variable Updates**: Integrated `variable-type-string.tsx` with history system

## ✅ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Connection Creation/Undo
1. **Add two nodes** using the add node button
2. **Create a connection** by dragging from an output connector to an input connector
3. **Check**: Undo button should be enabled
4. **Press Ctrl+Z**
5. **Expected**: Connection should disappear immediately
6. **Press Shift+Ctrl+Z** 
7. **Expected**: Connection should reappear

### Test 2: Variable Updates/Undo
1. **Add a node** that has string variables (most nodes have these)
2. **Click on the node** to select it and open the dock panel on the right
3. **Change a variable value** by typing in a text field
4. **Check**: Undo button should be enabled
5. **Press Ctrl+Z**
6. **Expected**: Variable should revert to previous value
7. **Press Shift+Ctrl+Z**
8. **Expected**: Variable should return to the changed value

### Test 3: Mixed Operations
1. **Add a node**
2. **Change a variable**
3. **Add another node** 
4. **Create a connection** between them
5. **Move one of the nodes**
6. **Now press Ctrl+Z multiple times**
7. **Expected**: Should undo each operation in reverse order:
   - Node position → connection → node addition → variable change → first node addition

### Test 4: Tooltip Feedback
1. **After creating a connection**, hover over undo button
2. **Expected**: Should show "Undo: Add connection: [source] → [target]"
3. **After changing a variable**, hover over undo button  
4. **Expected**: Should show "Undo: Update variable: [varName] in [nodeName]"

## 🎯 Integration Points

### Connection Creation (`useOutConnectorHandler.ts`):
- **Line ~119**: Uses `connectionHistoryActions.addConnectionWithHistory(finalConnection)`
- **Behavior**: Creates temporary connection for drag visual, then finalizes with history when dropped

### Variable Updates (`variable-type-string.tsx`):
- **Line ~38**: Uses `nodeHistoryActions.updateNodeVariableWithHistory(nodeId, variable.handle, newValue)`
- **Behavior**: Each text field change creates a history entry

## 📝 Notes

- **Connection Deletion**: Not yet implemented (connections might not have delete UI)
- **Other Variable Types**: Only string variables are integrated, other types (boolean, number, etc.) still need integration
- **Batching**: Each variable change creates separate history entries (could be optimized later)

## 🐛 Potential Issues

1. **Variable Input Lag**: Each keystroke might create history entries - consider debouncing
2. **Connection Visual**: Temporary connection during drag is not in history (by design)
3. **Incomplete Coverage**: Not all variable types are integrated yet

## 🚀 Status: Ready for Testing!

Try creating connections and changing variables - the undo/redo buttons should become active and work immediately!
